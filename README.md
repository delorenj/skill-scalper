# Skill Scalper: For your Computer

_A new way to do computer stuff, from the makers of "Computers!"_

## What is this dang thing?

So you got a computer. Great! But what if your computer could... do _more_? What if it could do things... for _you_? That's Skill Scalper. It's like a little guy for your computer, but he's not a guy, he's a program. A computer guy. He lives in there. And he helps you out. For what? For computer business.

Tired of all the clicking and the typing? I know I am. My fingers get so tired. Sometimes I just wanna lay down. With Skill Scalper, you just tell the computer what you want. Like, "Hey computer, make me a website for my pet shrimp." And the computer guy, he does it. He knows all the codes. He's a real whiz. A computer whiz kid.

It's got these things called "agents." They're like little bees. A whole swarm of 'em. A hive mind, they call it. All buzzin' around in your computer, doin' your work. It's like having a whole office of tiny little guys in your computer box. Pretty cool, huh? For computer prorgams only.

## Features, you dingus!

- **Agent Swarms:** Lots of little computer guys working together. Like a team. A computer team.
- **Hive Mind:** They all think together. One big brain. A computer brain. Don't get stung! By the bees. The computer bees.
- **Self-Healing:** If one of the little guys gets sick, another one takes his place. They don't have doctors in there. It's a computer, not a hospital.
- **Smart Spawning:** It makes new little guys when it needs 'em. Like magic. Computer magic.
- **Works with Claude and Crush:** I don't know who they are. Friends of the computer guy, I guess. Probably nice fellas.

## How to put it in your Computer

Okay, this part's for the computer prorgamrs. If you're not a computer prorgramr, go get one. Their like AI but way more spensiv. and smell like Cheetos and grampaw.

First, you gotta get all the stuff. All the computer parts.

```bash
# Get the stuff
git clone https://github.com/delorenj/skill-scalper.git
cd skill-scalper
```

Then you gotta tell the computer to make it. It's like baking a cake. With bees. Computer bees.

```bash
# Make the cake
./verify.sh
```

If it doesn't work, just try it again. Sometimes computers are shy. You gotta be nice to 'em. Or maybe you typed it wrong, Dr. Janglers.

## How to use it

Just talk to it. Like I'm talkin' to you. But to the computer. Use the terminal. That's the black box with the letters.

```bash
# Talk to the computer guy
claude --prompt "hey computer guy, make me a cool website about horses"
```

Then just wait. He's workin'. He's a busy guy. He'll tell you when he's done. Don't rush him. He's doin' his best.

## Wanna help?

Sure, why not. If you're a computer whiz, you can help the computer guy. Just make a pull request. I don't know what that is. Sounds like a workout. But the computer guys know. They're smart.

## License

It's free. For you. A free computer guy. What a deal. From me, to you. 'Cause i don't sleep. For your health!
